    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        As defined in the Black’s Law Dictionary, a Statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative authority
        that governs a country, state, city, or county.
        Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare policy.
        The word is often used to distinguish law made by legislative bodies from the judicial decisions of the common
        law and the regulations issued by Government agencies.
        <br>
        Constitution of India is federal in nature. In India, legislature has a power to make laws.
        And this laws are implemented by court to serve the justice.
        Indian Constitution has a separate judiciary and legislature system and separate powers are vested on them.
        Separation of powers means courts can not make laws and legislature can not exercise the function of courts.
        It is presumed that the clear and unambiguous laws are made by the legislature.
        However in some cases, the meaning of the fact and provisions of the laws are not clear then in that case court
        has a power to find the intension of the legislature to get a clear meaning.
        "intention of the legislature" refers to the meaning of the words used by the legislature objectively determined
        with the guidance furnished by accepted principles of interpretation.
        Internal and External Aids are two forms of interpretation which helps courts in finding out intention of
        legislature.
        <br>
        Jurists take the help of both Rules and Aids in the interpretation of Statutes.
        As stated by the Supreme Court in K.P. Varghese v. Income Tax Officer, Ernakulam, interpretation of statute
        being an exercise in the ascertainment of meaning,
        everything which is logically relevant should be admissible.
        A Rule is a uniform or established course of things. There are three rules of interpretation of statutes-
        Literal, Golden and Mischief.
        An Aid, on the other hand is a device that helps or assists.
        For the purpose of construction or interpretation, the court has to take recourse to various internal and
        external aids.

    </p>
    <h2>Meaning of Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
        Interpretation means the process used to ascertain the meaning of the statute by ascertaining the intention of
        the legislature for the enactment of that statute.
        It is used in case the meaning of an enactment is unclear and there is a lot of ambiguity.
        If the meaning of the words in the enactment is clear then there is no need for interpretation.
        <br>
        Salmond says that “interpretation is the process by which court seeks to ascertain the meaning of legislature
        through medium of authoritative form in which it is expressed”.
        <br>
        According to the Cross, "interpretation is the process by which the court determine the meaning of a statutory
        provisions for the purpose of applying it to the situation before them."
    </p>

    <h2>Need of Interpretation</h2>
    <p>The need of interpretation only arises is cases where meaning of an enactment is not clear and is ambiguous.
        This is case where a particular enactment gives more than one meaning. So by interpretation we can find the true
        meaning of enactment.
        This helps us in finding iut the true intention of the legislature.
        <br>
        The court has their own discretion while interpretation but they should focus only in finding out the intention
        of legislature and should not change the meaning of an enactment according to their own thinking.
        This helps in achieving the justice and helps in finding the logical meaning to an enactment.
        <br>
        According to the Maxwell, the object of all interpretation of a statute is to determine what intension is
        conveyed,
        either expressly or impliedly, by the language used, so far as is necessary for determining whether the
        particular case or state of facts
        presented to the interpreter falls within it.
    </p>

    <h2>Internal Aid</h2>
    <p>
        The internal aids to interpretation are those which may be contained in the statute itself forming a part of it
        or may not form the part of the statute.
        They are generally taken as important aid to interpretation whenever there is ambiguity in the language of the
        statute and meaning of the words are not clear.
        However they have no role to play in case where meaning of the statute is clear.
        They are much more valuable than external aid to interpretation.
        Internal aids mean those aids which are available in the statute itself, though they may not be part of
        enactment.

        <br>
        A statute is an edict of the legislature. It is expressed in definite words orderly arranged and for convenience
        sake
        divided in to various parts. this various parts constitutes the internal(or intrinsic) aids to construction. It
        is an important
        principle of construction that statute must be read as a whole and in its context. the enacting provisions must
        be read
        and understood in the context of the entire scheme of the act.
        <br>
        Various parts of statute that is internal aids are as follows:
        <br>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Sections</li>
        <li>Title</li>
        <li>Preamble</li>
        <li>Headings</li>
        <li>Marginal Notes</li>
        <li>Punctuations and brackets</li>
        <li>Illustrations</li>
        <li>Definations, Interpretation clause and General Clauses Act</li>
        <li>Proviso</li>
        <li>Explanation</li>
        <li>Schedules</li>
        <li>Transitional Provisions</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Title of the Statute
    </h3>
    <p>
        Maxwell: Nearly all the modern Acts, have both a long title and short title.
        <br>
        <em><strong>Long Title</strong> </em>
        <br>
        Every Statute is headed by a long title and it gives the description about the object of an Act.
        For e.g. the long title of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is – “An Act to consolidate and amend the laws
        relating to the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature”.
        <br>
        In recent times, long title has been used by the courts to interpret certain provision of the statutes.
        However, it is useful only to the extent of removing the ambiguity and confusions and is not a conclusive aid to
        interpret the provision of the statute.
        <br>
    </p>
    <em>Cases:</em>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>In Re Kerala Education bill, the Supreme Court held that the policy and purpose may be deduced from the
            long title and the preamble.</li>
        <li>In Manohar Lal v. State of Punjab, Long title of the Act is relied as a guide to decide the scope of the
            Act.</li>
        <li>In the case of Amarendra Kumar Mohapatra v. State of Orissa, the Court held that the title of a statute
            determines the general scope of the legislation, but the true nature of any such enactment must always be
            determined on the basis of its substance, not on the basis of the label given to it.
        </li>
        <li>The Supreme Court, in M.P.V. Sundararamier & Co. v. State of A.P., considered whether the impugned enactment
            was in the true sense a Validation Act. This Court held that while the short title as well as the marginal
            note described the Act as a Validation Act, that description was not answered by the substance of the
            legislation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Although the title is a part of the Act, it is in itself not an enacting provision and though useful in case of
        ambiguity of the enacting provisions, is ineffective to control their clear meaning.

        <br>
        <em><strong>Short Title</strong> </em>
        <br>
        The short title of an Act is for the purpose of reference & for its identification.
        It ends with the year of passing of the Act.
        For e.g. Section 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, says –“This Act may be cited as the Code of Civil
        Procedure, 1908.
        It shall come into force on the first day of January, 1909.”
        <br>
        Even though short title is the part of the statute, it does not have any role in the interpretation of the
        provisions of an Act.
    </p>
    <h3>Preamble
    </h3>
    <p>
        The main objective and purpose of the Act are found in the Preamble of the Statute.
        It is a preparatory statement and contains the recitals showing the reason for enactment of the Act.
        For e.g. the Preamble of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, is “Whereas it is expedient to provide a general Penal
        Code for India; it is enacted as follows”.
        <br>
        The preamble to a statute such as the long title is part of the Act, and is an admissible construction aid.
        While not an enacting element, the preamble is required to more comprehensively articulate the nature, object,
        and intent of the Act than the long title. It will recite the basis and cause of creating the law, the evils
        that have been sought to be remedied or the concerns that may be intended for settlement. In the words of Sir
        John Nicholl: “It is more precisely in the preamble that we must look for the purpose or meaning of each
        statute, rehearsing it as normal, the evils sought to be remedied, or the doubts expected to be eliminated by
        the law, and thus evidencing, in the best and most appropriate manner, the object or aim of the Legislature to
        render or pass the legislation.[9]
        <br>
    </p>
    <em>Cases:</em>
    <br>
    <ol>
        <li>In the case of West Bengal v. Anwar Ali, the constitutionality of Section 5 of the Special Courts Act of
            West Bengal, 1950 was challenged on the grounds of violation of Article 14 of the Constitution, because the
            provision in the Act authorizes the State Government to pick a specific case which deserves to be tried by
            special courts having separate proceedings. The Supreme Court took advantage of the preamble to the said Act
            and held that it was the right of the state government to select such cases.
        </li>
        <li>In Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, where the Apex Court strongly relied on the Preamble to the
            Constitution of India in finding that the Parliament ‘s power to amend the Constitution pursuant to Article
            368 was not limitless and did not allow Parliament to change the Basic Constitutional Structure.
        </li>
        <li>In Kashi Prasad v. State The court held that even though the preamble cannot be used to defeat the enacting
            clauses of a statute, it can be treated as a key for the interpretation of the statute.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The preamble can, without question, be used to address any ambiguity or to correct the meaning of terms that may
        have more than one meaning, but it cannot, however, be used to delete the operative clause of a statute as
        unnecessary or unintended. A preamble retrospectively incorporated into an earlier Act is of little aid in
        gathering the original Act’s meaning. Similarly, the repeal of a simpliciter preamble does not appear to affect
        the structure of the Law.
        <br>
        The preamble is an intrinsic aid in the interpretation of an ambiguous act.
    </p>

    <h3>Marginal Notes
    </h3>
    <p>Marginal notes are those notes that are inserted in the Act alongside the sections and reflect the effect of the parts. 
        These are also regarded as side notes. 
        Support was often taken from the marginal notes in the olden days when the simple sense of the acting was in question. But the court’s modern view is that marginal notes do not play any part when reading a statute. The basis of this view is that the marginal notes are not part of a statute since they are not added by the legislators, nor are they written in margin according to the legislature’s directives or authority. The drafters insert these notes and they may be incorrect at times, too.
<br>
        The legislature did not make marginal notes in the older statutes, and were thus not part of the statute and could not be referred to for the purpose of creating the statute. 
        If the legislature also enacts them they can be referred to for interpretation purposes. 
        In the case of the Indian Constitution, the Constituent Assembly has adopted the marginal notes and can, thus, be referred to for interpretation of the Constitutional Articles. 
        If the words used in the statute are plain and unambiguous, then the marginal note cannot regulate the context, but the marginal note can be referred to in the event of uncertainty or doubt.
        
       </p>
       <em>Cases:</em>
       <br>
    <ol><li>
        It has been noted that it is well known that the marginal notes to parts of an act of Parliament cannot be included in the building up of the law in Thakurain Balraj Kanwar RAO Jagatpal Singh.

    </li>
    <li> In P. Gupta v. President of India, the High Court held that the marginal note was necessary if the specific provisions of the body of a law clearly showed that the building would be inconsistent with the marginal note. 
        If the provisions in the body of the law are vague, the marginal note can be interpreted as construction assistance.
    </li>
    <li>        Wilkes v. Goodwin Banks, LJ, held that the side notes are not part of the Act and hence marginal notes cannot be referred.
    </li>
</ol>
<h3>Proviso</h3>
<p>A proviso has the proper purpose of accepting and dealing with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main statute and its consequence is limited to that case. 
    It is an example of the previous act that is too commonly articulated to be specific. As a general rule, a proviso to qualify or establish an exception to the provisions in the decree is inserted and a proviso is not generally perceived as stating a general rule. 
    A proviso would not usually go beyond what is proviso. It is seeking an exception to the principal clause to which it is a proviso and to no other rule. 
    With the exception of something out of the statute, the usual purpose of a law is to exempt something enacted therein which would be within the purview of the statute except for the proviso.
<br>
    As stated in Mullins v. Treasury of Survey, when one sees a proviso to a section, the normal presumption is that, but for the proviso, 
    the section’s enacting portion would have included the provisional subject-matter. 
    A proviso has the proper purpose of accepting and dealing with a case which would otherwise fall within the general language of the main 
    statute and its consequence is limited to that case. 
    It is a requirement of the preceding statute articulated in terms that are too general to be sufficiently precise. 
    As a general rule, a clause is applied to a statute in order to allow or establish an exception to what is specified in the law, and a clause is not usually viewed as a general rule.
</p>
<h3>Schedules</h3>
<p>
    Schedules annexed to the Act usually deal with how claims or privileges under the Act are to be claimed or with the exercise of powers granted by the Act. 
    Towards the end of the act, the Schedules are appended. 
    Sometimes, a schedule can include certain subjects in the form of a list, as is the case with India’s Constitution, allowing the Union and the states to legislate in their respective areas. 
    Schedules are parts of the Law itself, which may be reviewed by the courts to interpret the law’s main component. 
    Similarly, aid can often be taken from the main body of the Act to figure out the true spirit of the Act when reading the timetables. 
    Sometimes a schedule can also include transitory provisions to allow a law to remain in effect until the key provisions of the Act, such as the 1935 Government of India Act’s Ninth Schedule, begin to function.
</p>
<em>Cases:</em>
<br>
<ol><li>
    In M/s. Aphali Pharmaceuticals Limited v. State of Maharashtra, the Supreme Court held that in case of a clash between the schedule and the main body of an Act, the main body prevails and the schedule has to be rejected.
</li>
<li> In Jagdish Prasad v. State of Rajasthan and others, the Supreme Court ruled that the purpose of a schedule is to advance the object of the main provision and deletion of schedule cannot wipe out provisions of an Act in effect and spirit.</li>

</ol>
<h2>External Aid</h2>
<p>
    The role of external aids to interpretation comes into play in case where internal aid fails. 
    Internal aid is considered more valuable in interpretation as compared to the external aid. 
    External aid are doesn’t form a part of the enactment itself like some internal aid and neither they are connected to any specific provision.
<br>
However in some cases where internal aid fails, help can be taken from external aids to ascertain the intention of the legislature as generally they talk about the history of an enactment and reasons for its introduction.
<br>
PrabhakarRao v. State of Andhra Pradesh
<br>
In this case it was observed that external aid comes into play only when the internal aid fails but not otherwise. 
It is for the purpose of the justice the external aids should be used. 
Legislative history, committee reports, debates etc may be considered for the same.


</p>
<p>
    The history of legislation, the enactments which are repealed, the parliamentary debates,
dictionary commentaries etc. are external aids to construction. It is important to point out here
that the legislature adopts the device of making a statute by “reference” and by “incorporation”.
When the statute is incorporated in another statue by the legislature, the incorporated statute or
statute referred to therein is external aid for interpreting the statute in question. There has been a
controversy in India regarding the use of parliamentary debates for interpreting the Constitution.
It is now settled that the court can always refer to the debates in the legislature while interpreting
the statute to know the intention if there is a doubt about the provision. More often than not, a
provision is introduced in the Bill and after some debate either it is altered or modified or 
amended before finally it receives the assent of the President. Such external aids are helpful in
interpreting the law.
<br>
External Aids are –
<ol type="I">
    <li>Parliamentary History, Historical Facts and Surrounding Circumstances</li>
    <li>Statement Of Objects And Reasons</li>
    <li>Reports of Commissions</li>
    <li>Dictionary</li>
    <li>Judicial Decisions</li>
    <li>Foreign decision/Judgments and Foreign Statutes</li>
    <li>Textbooks</li>
    <li>International Law: Treaties and Conventions</li>
    <li>Contemporanea Expositio or contemporaneous Exposition or Construction</li>
    <li>Government Circulars, Publications (Reports of Commissions and Committees)</li>
</ol>
</p>
<h3>Parliamentary History, Historical Facts and Surrounding Circumstances</h3>
<p>
    If the wordings are ambiguous, the historical setting may be considered in order to arrive at the
    proper construction, which covers parliamentary history, historical facts, statement of objects and
    reasons, report of expert committees.
</p>
<h4>a. Parliamentary history</h4>
<p>
    means the includes conception of an idea, drafting of the bill, the
debates made, the amendments proposed, speech made by mover of the bill, etc. Papers placed
before the cabinet which took the decision for the introduction of the bill are not relevant since
these papers are not placed before the parliament.
The Supreme Court in S.R. Chaudhuri v. State of Punjab and others (2001) has stated that it is a
settled position that debates in the Constituent Assembly may be relied upon as an aid to
interpret a Constitutional provision because it is the function of the Court to find out the intention
of the framers of the Constitution.
<br>
But as far as speeches in Parliament are concerned, a distinction is made between speeches of the
mover of the Bill and speeches of other Members.
<br>
Regarding speeches made by the Members of the Parliament at the time of consideration of a
Bill, it has been held in K.S. Paripoornan v. State of Kerala and others (1995) that they are not
admissible as extrinsic aids to the interpretation of the statutory provision. However, speeches 

made by the mover of the Bill or Minister may be referred to for the purpose of finding out the
object intended to be achieved by the Bill.
</p>
<h4>b. Historical facts</h4>
<p>
    Historical facts of the statute are the external circumstances in which it was enacted. The
    object is to understand whether the statute in question was intended to alter the law or leave it
    where it stood.
    <br>
    In order to arrive at the intention of the legislature, the state of law and judicial decisions
    antecedent to and at the time the statute was passed are material matters to be considered.
    Evidence of matters relating to such surrounding circumstances and historical investigation of
    which judicial note can be taken by court, including reports of select committees and statements
    of objects and reasons, can be resorted to for ascertaining such antecedent law and for
    determining the intention of the legislature. But the bill and reports of select committee are not
    legitimate material for arriving at the construction of a statute, that is, for finding the meaning of
    words.
    <br>
    Parliamentary debates on the floor legislature are also inadmissible, because, the court is
    concerned only with what the legislature actually said in the statute. Moreover, plain words in
    the statute cannot be limited by any considerations of policy.
    An erroneous assumption by the legislature as to the state of the law has no effect and would not
    become a substantive enactment. In the construction of a statute the worst person to construe it is
    the person who is responsible for its drafting. Courts sometimes make a distinction between
    legislative debates and reports of committees and treat the latter as a more reliable or satisfactory
    source of assistance. The speeches made by the members of the House in the course of the debate
    are not admissible as extrinsic aids to the interpretation of statutory provisions.
    <br>
    It cannot be said that the acceptance or rejection of amendments to a Bill in the course of
    Parliamentary proceedings forms part of the pre-enactment history of a statute and as such might
    throw valuable light on the intention of the Legislature when the language used in the statute
    admitted of more than one interpretation. The reason why a particular amendment was proposed
    or accepted or rejected is often a matter of controversy and without the speeches bearing upon
    the motion, it cannot be ascertained with any reasonable degree of certainty. And where the 
    
    Legislature happens to be bicameral, the second Chamber may or may not have known of such
    reason when it dealt with the measure.
    <br>
    In (Keats v. Lewis Merthbyr Consolidated Collieries Ltd. (1911) it was held that the external aid
    in the form of historical facts and circumstances surrounding the legislation is necessary and
    quite useful in understanding the subject matter of the statute and thereby to arrive at the
    legislative intent. 
</p>
<h3>Statement Of Objects And Reasons </h3>
<p>
    Statement of objective and reasons provides why the statute is being brought to enactment. It is
permissible to refer to it for understanding the background, the antecedent state of affairs, the
surrounding circumstances in relation to the statute and the evil which the statute sought to
remedy. The Statement of Objects and Reasons, seeks only to explain what reasons induced the
mover to introduce the bill in the House and what objects he sought to achieve. But those objects
and reasons may or may not correspond to the objective which the majority of members had in
view when they passed it into law. The Bill may have undergone radical changes during its
passage through the House or Houses, and there is no guarantee that the reasons which led to its
introduction and the objects thereby sought to be achieved have remained the same throughout
till the Bill emerges from the House as an Act of the Legislature, for they do not form part of the
Bill and are not voted upon by the members. The Statements of Objects and Reasons appended
to the Bill should be ruled out as an aid to the construction of a statute
</p>
<h3>Reports of Commissions</h3>
<p>
    Reports of Commissions including Law Commission or Committees including Parliamentary
Committees preceding the introduction of a Bill can also be referred to in the Court as evidence
of historical facts or of surrounding circumstances or of mischief or evil intended to be remedied.
<br>
The Supreme Court in Rosy and another v. State of Kerala and others (2000) considered Law
Commission of India, 41st Report for interpretation of section 200 (2) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, 1898.
<br>
Earlier courts, while interpreting a provision in a statute used to refer legislative history to
ascertain its clear and complete meaning. The Traditional English Courts used to refer the report of a Committee presented to the Parliament/Legislature as an external aid. But the modern trend
seems to be that legislative history is not permissible as an aid to interpretation.
<br>
In A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras (1950 ), the Supreme Court observed that the debates in
Parliament on a bill are not admissible for the construction of an act. However, it became
incompatible to the Supreme Court to refer legislative history as an aid, while interpreting a
provision in the statute.

<h3>
    Dictionary
</h3>
<p>
    The meaning of particular words in an Indian statute is to be found not so much in a strict
etymological propriety of language nor even in popular sense, as in the subject or occasion on
which they used. But it is well known that words are generally used in their ordinary sense and
therefore, though dictionaries are not to be taken as authoritative in regard to the meanings of the
words used in statutes, they may be consulted. In Voltas Ltd. v. Rolta India Ltd.(2014) the
Supreme Court has held that:
<br>
“Dictionaries can hardly be taken as authoritative exponents of the meanings of the words used
in legislative enactments for the plainest words may be controlled by a reference to the context.”
<br>
Therefore, the dictionaries are referred/consulted by the courts, whenever need arises to find out
the ordinary sense of the words. However, the courts must be very careful while referring the
dictionaries because the dictionary meaning of the word may not be true at all times in a
particular sense. If a word or an expression in an Act has been defined, there is no need to refer
the dictionary to find out its general meaning. One of the main objects of every dictionary of the
English Language is to give an adequate and comprehensive definition of every word contained
in it. Dictionaries are referred to, not only for meaning of the word, but also to find out the
general use of it.

<h3>Judicial Decisions</h3>
<p>
    Decisions by courts on the same manner act as precedents for the interpretation of statutes.
Indian judicial pronouncements may have binding value when issued by a higher court, and have
persuasive value when issued by a court having same or lower authority. These foreign decisions 
from countries following the same system of jurisprudence have persuasive value only and
cannot be used to contradict binding Indian judgements.
<br>
Under this rule, a principle of law which has become settled by a series of decisions is generally
binding on the courts and should be followed in similar cases. The rule is based on expediency
and public policy. It is however not universally applicable. For example, if grievous wrong may
result, a court will not follow the previous decisions which, they are convinced, are erroneous.
While dealing with the provision of Sec. 207 of the Motor Vehicle Act, 1988, Hon’ble Mr.
Justice C.K. Thakkar in the case of Ramkrishna Bus Transport and Ors v. State of Gujarat and
Ors, (1995) held that, whether a particular provision is mandatory or directory depends upon
intention of the Legislature and not only upon the language in which it is used. The meaning and
intention of the Legislature must be treated as decisive and they are to be ascertained not only
form the phraseology used but also by considering the nature, design and consequences which
would flow from construing it one way or the other. It is also true that in certain circumstances,
the expression ‘may’ can be construed as ‘shall’ or vice versa. At the same time, however, it
cannot be ignored that ordinarily ‘may’ should read as ‘may’ which is permissive and not
obligatory. For the purpose of giving effect to the clear intention of the legislature, ‘may’ can be
read as ‘shall’ or ‘must’.
<br>

In Mahadeolal Kanodia v. Administrator General of W.B., (1960) the Supreme Court was
concerned with the retrospectivity of law passed by the West Bengal Legislature concerning the
rights of tenants and in para 8 of the judgment the Supreme Court held that:
“The principles that have to be applied for interpretation of statutory provisions of this nature
are well established. The first of these is that statutory provisions creating substantive rights or
taking away substantive rights are ordinarily prospective; they are retrospective only if by
express words or by necessary implication...”
<br>
In Amireddi Raja Gopala Rao v. Amireddi Sitharamamma,(1965) a Constitution bench was
concerned with the issue as to whether the rights of maintenance of illegitimate sons of a Sudra
as available under the Mitakshara School of Hindu law were affected by introduction of Sections
4, 21 and 22 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. The Court held that they were
not, and observed in as follows: 
<br>

“. ... a statute should be interpreted, if possible, so as to respect vested rights, and if the words
are open to another construction, such a construction should never be adopted.”
<br>
In the case of Narmada Bachao Andolan v. State of Madhya Pradesh & Anr., (2011) the
Supreme Court has observed that:
<br>
“The Court should not place reliance upon a judgment without discussing how the factual
situation first in with a fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed, as it has to be
ascertained by analyzing all the material facts and the issues involved in the case and argued on
both sides. A judgment may not be followed in a given case if it has some distinguishing features.
A little difference in facts or additional facts may make a lot of difference to the presidential
value of a decision. A judgment of Court is not to be read as a statute, as it is to be remembered
that judicial utterances have been made in setting of the facts of a particular case. One
additional or different fact may make a world of difference between the conclusions in two cases.
Disposal of case by blindly placing reliance upon a decision is not proper.”
<br>
In the case of Sakshi v. Union of Inaia & Others, (2004) the Supreme Court has observed that:
<br>
“ Stare decisis is a well-known doctrine in legal jurisprudence. The doctrine of stare decisis,
meaning to stand by decided cases, rests upon the principle that law by which men are governed
should be fixed, definite and known, and that, when the law is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction authorized to construe it, such declaration, in absence of palpable mistake or error,
is itself evidence of the law until changed by competent authority. It requires that rules of law
when clearly announced and established by a court of last resort should not be lightly
disregarded and set aside but should be adhered to and followed. What is precludes is that
where a principle of law has become established by a series of decisions, it is binding on the
courts and should be followed in similar cases. It is a wholesome doctrine which gives certainty
to law and guides the people to mould their affairs in future”.

<h3>Textbooks</h3>
<p>
    Sometimes, courts, while interpreting a statute refer textbooks authored by distinguished jurists
and eminent scholars, so as to arrive at a true meaning of an enactment. However, it is not
necessary that the meaning of the words given in the textbooks should correspond to the
views/opinions of the Courts. In certain cases, Vedas are quoted with approval by the courts. For
example- Manu Smriti, Agna Valkya Smriti, Jimutavahana, Vignaneswara, Kanitilya etc.
<br>
Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (1973)
<br>
In this case, the Supreme Court referred a large number of textbooks. The majority opinion was
that, in view of many opinions and counter opinions expressed by the authors and jurists in the
textbooks, it was not desirable to follow the opinions quoted in the textbooks
</p>
<h3>Foreign decision/Judgments and Foreign Statutes</h3>
<p>Most of the Indian Legislations are modeled on the previous English Statutes. Similarly, the
    principles laid down in many decisions of the common law courts in England have been 
    approved and followed in Indian Courts. Therefore, the Indian legal system is the replica of the
English jurisprudence. Reference to English and American decisions may be made, because they
have the same system of jurisprudence as ours, but do not prevail when the language of the
Indian statute or enactment is clear. They are of assistance in elucidating general principles and
construing Acts in pari material. But Indian statutes should be interpreted with reference to the
facts of Indian life.
<br>
Before independence i.e before the establishment of the apex court in India, appeals from the
Indian High Courts were heard by the Privy Council were followed and applied in Indian Courts,
even after the independence till date. It is to be noted that a number of statutes in India,
substantial and procedural namely the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
etc. were drafted by the British Parliament, which are applied in Indian Courts.
</p>
<h3>Government Circulars, Publications (Reports of Commissions and Committees)</h3>
<p>
    Government Circulars, Publications and Reports have been considered as external aids in
construction of statutes. Hence, the courts, at the time of interpretation of statutes. Hence, the
Courts at the time of interpretation refer them, unless they do not go against the spirit of statute
under which they are issued.
<br>
In Express Newspapers Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India (1958)- The Supreme Court referred the Press
Commission’s Report.
<br>
Therefore, it can be concluded that the importance of use of these aids is manifest. In any case,
where difficulty arises as to finding out the true intention of the legislature, the use of these
materials could be made by the Courts. Of course, in India, there is no consistent and uniform
approach to the use of extrinsic materials in the sense of determining as aids for the purpose of
interpretation of a given statute. Undoubtedly, individually as well as collectively, they are very
much useful in finding out the true intention of the legislature. Of course, recourse to these aids
could only be made in case of possibility of more than one interpretation of a given statute.
</p>
<h3>International Law: Treaties and Conventions</h3>
<p>
    One of the most important branches of public law is International law. It is of two kinds- Public
International Law and Private International Law/Conflict of Law. International Law is a body of
rules and principles, which regulate the conduct and relations of the members of the International
Community (UNO or U.N.). The term convention literally means “the act of convening a
conference as assembly, representatives or delegates assembled for a common cause”. EgUnited Nations Convention on Law of Sea, 1982. Whereas the term treaty means an agreement 
entered into between two or more states (countries) on a particular subject. Eg- an agreement
between India and Pakistan is called Indo-Pak Treaty.
